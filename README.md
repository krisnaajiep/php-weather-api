## General Information
PHP Weather APi is a weather API that fetches and returns weather data from [Visual Crossing's API](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api). This API uses [Redis](https://redis.io) for caching and [phpdotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv) for loads environment variables. This project is designed to explore and practice working with the 3rd party API, Caching and Environment Variables in PHP.

## Technologies Used
- PHP - version 8.3.6
- Redis (via [Predis](https://github.com/predis/predis)) - version 7.4.1

## Features
- **Real-Time Weather Data**: Fetch up-to-date weather information for any location.
- **Location-Based Queries**: Retrieve weather details by specifying the desired location in the query parameter.
- **Caching for Faster Responses**: Utilizes Redis caching to store weather data temporarily, reducing API requests and improving response times.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implements rate limiting to prevent excessive API calls, ensuring fair usage and maintaining service reliability.
- **JSON Responses**: Returns structured JSON data, making it easy to integrate with front-end applications or other systems.
- **Customizable**: Easily configurable base URL and API key via environment variables `.env`, allowing seamless integration with different weather API providers.

## Setup
To run this API, youâ€™ll need:
- PHP: Version 8.3 or newer
- Redis: Version 7.4 or newer
